## About the language

C is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has become one of the most widely used languages for system programming, embedded systems, and application development due to its efficiency, simplicity, and close interaction with hardware.

#### Key features of C include:

- Low-level memory access through pointers, making it suitable for system-level programming.
- Portability, allowing code to run on a wide range of platforms with minimal modification.
- Procedural programming model, focusing on functions and structured programming.
- Rich set of operators and built-in libraries for various tasks.

C's syntax has heavily influenced many other programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.

For a project written in C, users typically need a C compiler like GCC or Clang to build and execute the code.
