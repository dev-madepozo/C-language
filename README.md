## About

Welcome to my C programming journey! This repository showcases a collection of projects that reflect my growth and exploration of the C language. Each project is crafted to highlight different aspects of C, from basic syntax to more complex concepts and algorithms. I use this space as both a practice ground and a playground for experimentation, constantly learning and refining my skills along the way.

Feel free to explore the projects, contribute, or offer suggestions!

## Getting Started

To get started with the projects in this repository, follow the steps below:

##### Prerequisites
Before running any of the projects, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **C Compiler** (e.g., GCC or Clang)
  - For Linux/macOS, you can use gcc or clang in the terminal.
  - For Windows, you may need to install [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/)

##### Cloning the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-madepozo/C-language.git
cd C-language
```

##### Compiling and Running Projects
1. Navigate to the program folder you want to work with.
2. Compile the code with your C compiler:

``` base
$ gcc -o program_name program_name.c
```
3. Run the compiled program:

``` bash
$ ./program_name
```

##### Project Structure
Each program is contained within its own directory and typically includes the following:

- Source Code: The `.c`files for each program.
- README (if applicable): A program-specific guide or exaplnation.

##### Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests if you'd like to contribute to any of the projects, suggest improvements, or add new challenges!

## C language

C is a general-purpose, high-performance programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has become one of the most widely used languages for system programming, embedded systems, and application development due to its efficiency, simplicity, and close interaction with hardware.

#### Key features of C include:

- Low-level memory access through pointers, making it suitable for system-level programming.
- Portability, allowing code to run on a wide range of platforms with minimal modification.
- Procedural programming model, focusing on functions and structured programming.
- Rich set of operators and built-in libraries for various tasks.

C's syntax has heavily influenced many other programming languages, including C++, Java, and Python.

For a project written in C, users typically need a C compiler like GCC or Clang to build and execute the code.
