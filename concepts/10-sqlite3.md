# Sqlite3 in C

SQLite3 is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured SQL database engine. It is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of integration with C programs.

## 1. Introduction to SQLite3

  SQLite3 is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike many other SQL database management systems, SQLite is not a client-server database engine but rather an embedded, self-contained, file-based database that integrates into your application. This makes it ideal for local storage, mobile apps, and small applications.

  To start using SQLite3 in C, you'll need to include the `sqlite3.h` header and link against the SQLite3 library.

  **Example:**

  ```c
  #include <sqlite3.h>

  int main() {
      sqlite3 *db;
      int rc = sqlite3_open("example.db", &db);
      if (rc) {
          printf("Can't open database: %s\n", sqlite3_errmsg(db));
      } else {
          printf("Opened database successfully\n");
      }
      sqlite3_close(db);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

## 2. SQLite3 Data Types

  SQLite3 uses dynamic typing, which means it doesn't strictly enforce data types as in other databases. For instance, you can insert a string value into a column that is defined as an integer type. However, SQLite3 does have a set of common data types.

  - **INTEGER**: Used for integer values. Can store values of any integer size.
  - **REAL**: Used for floating-point numbers.
  - **TEXT**: Used for strings (UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32).
  - **BLOB**: Used for storing binary data (e.g., images, files).
  
  SQLite3â€™s data types are more flexible than strict SQL implementations. It allows you to store any type of value in any column, but it does have "preferred" types for certain operations.

  **Example:**

  ```c
  sqlite3_stmt *stmt;
  const char *sql = "INSERT INTO users (id, name, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
  sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, sql, -1, &stmt, 0);

  // Bind data to the placeholders
  sqlite3_bind_int(stmt, 1, 1);            // INTEGER
  sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, "Alice", -1, SQLITE_STATIC); // TEXT
  sqlite3_bind_int(stmt, 3, 30);           // INTEGER

  // Execute the query
  sqlite3_step(stmt);

  // Finalize the statement
  sqlite3_finalize(stmt);
  ```
